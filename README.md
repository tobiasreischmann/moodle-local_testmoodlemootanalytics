# moodle-local_testmoodlemootanalytics
Local plugin which was created at the MoodleMoot 2018 in Germany as part of a spontaneous DevCamp about the new Moodle Analytics API.

The created target selects all courses, which consists of only resource modules and a forum.

Thanks to Elizabeth Dalton and Luca BÃ¶sch for this spontaneous DevCamp and the collaboration.
